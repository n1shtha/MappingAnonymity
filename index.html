    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
      We know the Partition through personal history, which means there is a lot missing: partly because of the messiness of memory, and partly because people have repressed or erased memories of violence. Thus, as DH researchers, we became invested in the value of what we do not know. In narratives where identity is a matter of life and death, what does it mean for a text to not reveal a characterâ€™s gender, religion, etc.? And what does it mean to not reveal their name, something so basic to their identity? In many ways, these are also concerns of data: what does it mean when a discipline that strives to categorise and label everything cannot cognise something in a text? 
      With this grounding, our map presents data about unnamed characters in Partition literature, and their presence in zones of religious conflict. We invite you to explore Partition in a new light through this data.
