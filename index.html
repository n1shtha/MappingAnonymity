    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>
      We know the Partition through personal history, which means there is a lot missing: partly because of the messiness of memory, and partly because people have repressed or erased memories of violence. Thus, as DH researchers, we became invested in the value of what we do not know. In narratives where identity is a matter of life and death, what does it mean for a text to not reveal a character’s gender, religion, etc.? And what does it mean to not reveal their name, something so basic to their identity? In many ways, these are also concerns of data: what does it mean when a discipline that strives to categorise and label everything cannot cognise something in a text? 
      With this grounding, our map presents data about unnamed characters in Partition literature, and their presence in zones of religious conflict. We invite you to explore Partition in a new light through this data.
    </p>

    <h3>Gender and Anonymity</h3>
    <p>
      First, we noticed that the border has a higher concentration of unnamed men and characters of unknown gender. The women are largely inland, highest in Delhi and Lucknow. Most likely, this is because of the violence at the border being so intense that names are forgeone easier. It could also be due to the presence of State bodies like the Army. 
      Women at the border are either more absent or more named than women inland. The former would mean that they crossed the border less—maybe the narratives placed them in the private sphere instead. The latter might be because they are mentioned in stories to bring up some aspect of their gender, and hence become important characters.
    </p>

  <section id="part_3">
    <h3>Gender and Anonymity in Space</h3>
    <p>
    Similarly, the percentages of unknown female characters in private spaces are notably smaller than those of unnamed female characters in public spaces, which further indicates the placement of the narratives of women primarily in private spaces. In zones of religious conflict, the percentage of unnamed male characters does not change significantly with distance from the border. This may be due to the texts chosen to be mapped, indicating an almost equal importance to the role of men in conflict, either as victims or perpetrators, both close to and away from the border.

    <h3>Through the lens: Manto's <em>Mozail</em></h3>
    <p>
      While our data allows us to think expansively about these concerns, it also cannot capture many nuances from the source texts. For example, in Manto’s <em>Mozail</em>, the mobs are not religiously identified in the original Urdu, while they are in English. In Urdu, they are simply called “woh” or “them”. The English feels the need to label the Other, while the Urdu is comfortable with just recognising the Other. Moreover, the one time the Urdu does employ religious identification, it is an innocuous “miyan sahib” (Muslim title), which the English changes to “awful bloodthirsty Muslims”. Language fundamentally dictates what and how much is named. Linguistic differences and translative choices change the register of signification entirely, which the map is incapable of reflecting.

  <section id="part_5">
    <h3>Through the lens: Singh's <em>Train to Pakistan</em></h3>
    <p>
      A vivid image invoked on mention of the Partition are the travels undertaken by the refugees towards both India and Pakistan, specifically that of persons “crammed into lorries, clinging to the sides and roofs of trains”, as is written in Khushwant Singh’s <em>Train to Pakistan</em>. The translative choices here turn the “daraavne” Muslims that Hindu and Sikh refugees run into to “panicky”, scary to scared; a significant, complete change in perspective. In means of travel occupying liminal spaces and those that elude difference as in Toba Tek Singh, the map cannot depict changes in perspective and the resulting changes in connotation.

    <h3>Location and Anonymity</em></h3>
    <p>
      By hovering over a hotspot, the location of the given spot appears - the user, therefore, for example, can view regions of conflict, or spaces with larger percentages of unnamed characters more conveniently. The map gives the user the ability to be acquainted with regions that are not necessarily popular in Partition narratives, but faced its horrors to equally high intensities. Trains, especially, as mentioned in Train to Pakistan, pass through multiple villages, with violent conflicts occuring at numerous instances. The user is therefore given the ability to explore unorthodox places of intrigue.
    </p>

  <section id="part_7">
    <h3>In conclusion:</em></h3>
    <p>
      By exploring mapped percentages of unnamed characters in several contexts, the user, whether a literary scholar interested in signification, a historian interested in political violence, or any learner curious about the Partition, is given the chance to inspect what narratives forget - the unidentified.
